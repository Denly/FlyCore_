<h2>Orientation</h2>
<p>
Using genetic or genomic approaches to address evolutionary questions is the most exciting research area in this field.  This is the site for students who are interested in pursuing his/her graduate training in the Joint Evolutionary Genetics and Genomic Group at National Taiwan University and Academia Sinica.  To us, a successful graduate training program should provide not only attractive research projects but training on the basic scientific skills.  This site is established for providing a set of basic readings which are essential for young students towards the aim.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

It is always good to start early and be well prepared for your future scientific career.  A list of reading here is recommended for all undergraduate or perspective graduate students.  Upon finishing all the required readings, you can move on to the essential reference list.
